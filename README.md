![Franklin M. Liang's hyphenation algorithm](https://ytiurin.github.io/hyphen/01.png)

# hyphen

This is a hyphenation library, based on Franklin M. Liang's [hyphenation algorithm](https://tug.org/docs/liang/ "Frank Liang wrote his Stanford Ph.D. thesis on a hyphenation algorithm that is standard in TeX, and has been adapted to numerous languages."). In core of the algorithm lies a set of hyphenation patterns. They are extracted from hand-hyphenated dictionaries. Patterns for this library were taken from [ctan.org](https://ctan.org/ "The Comprehensive TEX Archive Network (CTAN) is the central place for all kinds of material around TEX.") and ported to Javascript.

```javascript
import { hyphenate } from "hyphen/en";

hyphenate("A certain king had a beautiful garden").then(result => {
  // A cer[-]tain king had a beau[-]ti[-]ful garden
  // [-] is soft hyphen
});
```

    // <blockquote>HTML tags are NOT hy[-]phen[-]at[-]ed</blockquote>
  }
);

hyphenateHTMLSync("<blockquote>Sync version of `hyphenateHTML`</blockquote>");

## Hyphenation in CSS

The CSS `hyphens` property is intended to add hyphenation support to modern browsers without Javascript:

```css
p {
  hyphens: auto;
}
```

It is part of the [CSS Text Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#hyphens-property) specification. The browser compatibility list can be found on the [related MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens).
